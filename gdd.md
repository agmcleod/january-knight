# January Game Idea - sidescroller knight

A simple sidescroller game where the player is a knight. Can fight against various monsters, and eventually to defeat a boss to save the kingdom.

## Story

The kingdom of Gamery-January is under assault by a legion of creatures. You must save it by being a bad ass knight!

## Gameplay

The gameplay will have generic sidescroller components. Combat will be focused around sword swinging. Might add bow/arrows later. Maybe some sort of mystical jump mechanic/upgrade.

## Art

To be done as pixel art.
